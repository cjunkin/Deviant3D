					<h2 class="alt">Summary</h2>
					<p>
						Did someone say waiting hours for a render? That's a fat NO for us, so we made Deviant3D, a
						multiplayer shooter game (in 3D, obviously). Deviant3D incorporates CS 184 topics such as
						geometry processing, lighting, animation, and physical simulation to bring the world,
						characters, and varying interactable objects to life.
					</p>
					<p>
						We used the open source Godot game engine to create this, and our problems were: Three of us
						were completely unfamiliar with Godot, and thus needed
						to learn the engine from scratch (sad face). Technical complications also arose, such
						as Godot's built in physics engine being non-deterministic (hard to sync the multiplayer, and
						also very funny glitches)
						and the inverse kinematics not quite being fully functional. To
						solve these two issues, we had to do a bit of reading (resources at bottom of
						website) and implemented our own physics and procedural animations.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our final result was a nicely polished multiplayer game (we even threw in a sobel edge detection
						shader for the low price of $0.00 and our sanity).
						We developed varying enemy types, powerups to aid combat, procedurally
						generated terrain, and many stylistic improvements. From post-processing shaders to
						offering both third-person and first-person perspectives, our game shaped up to be a nice
						looking
						pile of fun!

					<h2>Technical Details</h2>
				</header>
				<!-- <a href="#" class="image featured"> -->

				<!-- </a> -->
				<p>So, you wanna know how this was made? What are you, a nerd? Ok ok, I'll tell you.</p>

				<p>Deviant3D was created using Godot, an open-source game engine, which made collision testing and basic
					rendering trivial. However, there were 3 main issues:
				<ol>
					<li>Godot's inverse kinematics was not bug free.</li>
					<li>
						Godot's inbuilt physics was nondeterministic (so not multiplayer friendly).
					</li>
					<li>The default lighting was rather bland, and turning up settings caused performance issues, since
						the folks at Godot are still working on performance.</li>
				</ol>
				</p>

				<p>
					To solve 1, I used tweening, interpolation, and animation blend trees, and a custom follow the
					leader algorithm
					for the worm.
					For simpler things like changing the camera position when switching between third and first person,
					I
					used a similar approach to bezier curves, parameterizing as
				</p>
				<p>
					\(\vec{P}(t) = ((1 - t) * \vec{S}) + (t * \vec{E})\)
				</p>
				<p>
					where \(\vec{P}\) is our position, \(\vec{S}\) is our starting position, and \(\vec{E}\) is our
					ending position. From there, as
					our time step increased, I used Godot's tweening to handle choosing the correct value of \(t\),
					since
					\(t\) could follow a linear increase from 0 to 1, or quadratic, or any other function.
				</p>
				<p>This was done for centering the gun, aiming the grappling hooks, aiming down sights, smoothly
					increasing enemy speed, and so forth.</p>
				<p>For first person animations, I used Godot's built in Animation Trees to blend between animation
					states, such as shooting transitioning
					to idle to walking and sprinting.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the worm, it rotated towards the player except I tried using a weird hack to get interpolation
					to
					rotate at a more constant rate towards the player without having to learn about quaternions. Here we
					are trying to set \(\vec{T}_{t+1}\) to an interpolated transform that is looking towards the player:
				</p>
				<p>
					\begin{array}{l}
					\vec{T}_{t} := \textrm{Transform of worm at time t} \\
					\vec{P} := \textrm{Transform of worm looking at player} \\
					\theta := \textrm{Angle between worm and player's forward basis vectors} \\
					\vec{T}_{t+1} = lerp(\vec{T}_{t}, \vec{P}, dt * 4 / \theta) \\
					\end{array}
				</p>
				<p>It didn't always work, but the effect was nice enough where I simply recursively had the other worm
					segments rotate towards the
					next segment until we didn't have any segments left to rotate, and then kept the distance between
					segments at a constant value
					by directly setting the segment positions to move forward until they were at that distance.
				</p>

				<p>
					To solve 2, nondeterministic physics, I used the built in collision detection and the Kinematic
					Body's
					move_and_slide function, which handles bouncing and sliding given an input velocity (but not
					rotating the player) to
					create our own deterministic physics
					system. it went like this (I did not incorporate mass yet, so everything is treated as mass
					1):
				</p>
				<p>
					\begin{array}{l}
					\vec{F} = gravity + inputs + jump + hook \\
					\vec{V} += \vec{F} * dt \\
					\vec{P} += \vec{V} * dt \\
					\end{array}
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, this is a massive oversimplification, I had lots of constants for air resistance,
					friction, clamping our max velocity, yada yada yada.
				</p>

				<p>For the grappling hook, I decided that rather than using it like a stiff rope, I'd use it more like a
					bungee chord to make it more fun. So, I experimented with the stiffness and set the rest length to
					about a third
					of the player's height, and also made the hook force have a max length so he didn't immediately fly
					off into oblivion.</p>
				<p>To solve the problem of infinite circling when grappling (similar to when the tangential force equals
					the
					outwards force of a planet, which causes it to stay in orbit, I dampened the current velocity when
					I added our new velocity, like so:</p>
				<p>
					\(\vec{V}_{t+1} = (\vec{V}_{t} * (1 - damp)) + (\vec{F}_{t+1} * dt)\)
				</p>
				<p>After that our player would still circle, but slowly but surely reel in, which allowed for nice
					circular maneuvers while still having the nice feeling of a bungee chord.
				</p>
				<p>
					The enemies also used a similar approach, using verlet integration with acceleration and velocity
					so they wouldn't infinitely circle but would have some
					momentum (having enemies that always move toward you aren't very satisfying).
				</p>

				<p>
					To actually create the world, it was almost entirely procedurally generated. For
					land, I created a 2D grid of squares of size \(s \times s\), then offset the vertices by a random
					amount \(\vec{R}\) such that \(\vec{R}\) was no more than \(\frac{s}{3}\) in distance away from its
					original position (and thus, the new quadrilaterals didn't intersect eachother).
				</p>
				<p>
					Next was iterating over those and creating meshes for them. The vertices were the 2D grid positions
					except offset up and down by a random amount so each block was flat
					overall but the grid overall was not flat.
				</p>
				<p>
					In terms of the very nitty gritty for mesh generation, I used the Godot ArrayMesh API to create
					24 vertices (since each edge touched had 2 points, and there were 12 edges) for
					12 triangular faces (a cuboid has 6 in real life, but non-triangle rendering is messy so they get
					split into 2 triangles) then calculated surface normals using the cross product between two edges on
					the face (getting the signs right were a pain).
				</p>
				<p>
					I then used Open Simplex Noise using the x and z coordinates to generate a smooth height transition
					between neighboring blocks, which resulted in the rather nice transitions between dirt, grass, and
					sea.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course, this generation can be optimized, since we actually only
					need 8 vertices, and since the grid is connected, we can make it all a couple connected meshes to
					decrease the amount of draw calls.
				</p>
				<p>
					For asteroids and trees, they both use similar approaches, where I go through
					a grid and then using open simplex noise and x and z coordinates, I choose
					whether there should be an asteroid there or not, and then give them random scaling values.

				</p>

				<p>
					In fact, I used Simplex Noise for the camera shake (if you can't tell by now, I
					quite enjoyed the smoothness) by setting its rotation to random values based on time.
					Normally, this would look very random and jittery, but with simplex noise it became a little
					smoother. Stylistically, I don't think it looks nicer (that's subjective of course) but it certainly
					should reduce motion sickness.
				</p>

				<p>
					For 3, graphical problems, we used GPU accelerated shaders and customizable graphics settings to
					solve this. If you have an absolute potato pc you can turn everything off, so only basic lighting
					(no shadows) will happen. However, Chris's sobel edge detection shader is low cost (since it's a
					post processing effect that only processes the 2D screen image) and makes the game look very nice,
					even at low settings.

					Insert writeup of shader
				</p>
				<p>
					For other shaders, as a last touch on Open Simplex noise, I used that to generate the sea foam in
					the water shader.
					For the foam around half submerged objects effect, I used the depth of the camera rays (if it hits
					the water then something else
					very quickly, we should create the foam, otherwise only generate the noisy foam), and used
					sine and cosine as functions of time to generate some nice waves using vertex displacement.
					Lastly we kind of used the hack found online where you take the screen texture, offset and distort
					it to get the reflection, although this backfired (if you fly really high, you'll see why) so maybe
					we'll fix it at some point.
				</p>
				<p>
					To get the cartoony effect of the water, we clamped values between certain ranges to be one value
					for
					that range, ie:
				</p>
				<pre>

						if (noise_sample > 0.0 && noise_sample < 0.4) albedo = 0.1;
						if (noise_sample > 0.4 && noise_sample < 0.8) albedo = 0.0;
						if (noise_sample > 0.8) albedo = 1f;

						Which could be further optimized into no if elses:

						float albedo = 0.1 * float(noise_sample > 0.0 && noise_sample <= 0.4) + 1.0 * float(noise_sample > 0.8);
				</pre>
				<p>
					The menu blur shader used mipmaps and bilinear interpolation between the mipmaps (extremely fast on
					the GPU).
				</p>

				<p>
					For snapping to surfaces, I used raycasts to detect the surfaces that players were standing or
					moving towards, then
					reoriented the player's basis vectors such that the forward vector stayed the same, the up vector
					became the normalized surface normal, and then the side vector
					was just the cross product of the up and forward vectors. I then interpolated between the two to get
					a smooth rotation.
				</p>

				<p>
					Two powerups implemented were the Gravity powerups, each of which either increase or lower the
					character's gravity by a factor of two. This was implemented by taking the gravity attribute of the
					player when it interacts with the powerup, and then choosing to either double or halve it. In
					addition, the powerup will be rendered uninteractable for a set period of time. After a timer of 15
					seconds expires, the gravity is then restored to what it originally was.
				</p>
				<p>

					Alongside the Gravity powerups was an Attack Buff, which increases the players shots and explosion
					damage by a factor of 2. This was done in a similar method to the Gravity powerups, where once the
					player interacts with the object, the player's global variables responsible to damage are doubled
					for a set period of time. In addition, the powerup is once again rendered uninteractable to prevent
					multiple usages.
				</p>

				<p>
					Toon Shader (Sobel Edge Detection Shader):
					To add a shader to the game without having to apply it to every 3D mesh that we have in the game, we used a 2D post-processing filter. The filter was included as a part of the HUD and covers the entire screen and the screen texture and screen UV coordinates were used to apply the shader in OpenGL. The cartoon-like shader was implemented using the sobel edge detection algorithm that we learned in class. This was done by sampling the screen texture, extracting the horizontal and vertical gradients using the matrices defined in class, calculating \(G_x\) and \(G_y\), and then computing the final result. The final cartoon-like result was done by using the RGB value of (0, 0, 0) to color the calculated edges black.
