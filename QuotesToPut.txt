I have everything I could ever want. Physically, I am bound, unable to escape the physics, the biology, but with my hooks and my friends, I know, in my mind, in my heart, I am free - free to fly, to live, to choose what my life means. 

Loss is inevitable. What is not, is staying chained to that loss; whether you lose this game, or lose a person dear to you, you may be overwhelmed, filled with fear, anger, sadness. But this chain, this pain is temporary. The creator of this game, the people you lose, they would not want you to stay shackled to your pain. As sure as the sun falls, then rises, so too will a new day, a chance to ascend from your loss. Hope and happiness are quite fickle things, but stick around, and they'll be sure to come back.

Emotions are powerful. The anger, the sorrow, the joy in your heart will empower you, sap your energy, lift your spirits; it ebbs and flows, a great river carving into your very soul. But you must learn not to control that river, but to channel it - you can build all the dams you want, but damned will the river be if it doesn't crash through your dams. Learning to feel the surge, to guide and ride it to victory like your majestic stallion will bring you to heights you never imagined possible.
